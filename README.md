## Instructions to run notebooks:
### ECG LSTM-CNN Model
    Lstm_inception.ipynb
    Open the notebook on colab or local jupyter environment and simply run all blocks in sequence. All datasets will automatically dowloaded in local session
    
    svm_hf.ipynb
    Open the notebook on colab or local environment. Make sure to put all the data files in svm_modelling_data in your working directory and change the paths to these files in the 
    releveant blocks in the notebook accordingly. Run all blocks
    
    seq_model_hf.ipynb
    Open the notebook in colab or local environment. Put all files present in ehr_data in your working directory and change the paths to these files in the relevant blocks accordingly. Run all 
    
    ehr_data_preprocessing.ipynb
    This notebook is for preprocessing and feature contrution. It takes the files in the ehr_data and creates a outputall.csv file which is provided in svm_modelling_data folder.
    To run this notebook open in colab or local environment and put all files in the ehr_data in your working directory and change the paths accordingly in relevant block in the notebook
